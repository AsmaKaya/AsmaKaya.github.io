# *About Me*
 
## *My Interests*

 One of the things that I love to do in my free time is *_spending time in the nature_*, I like to walk in the woods to clear my mind and refresh my energy_. I also enjoy *_gardening_* and taking care of the plants in the backyard of my house, I am planning to grow vegetables in the backyard this year, that makes me even more excited. However, the most precious moments are moments that I spend with *_my family_* to make unforgettable memories that stay lifelong. So, I am a mom of two cute twin boys aged 13 months old, and two beautiful daughters aged 8 and 10 years, they mean the world to me as they are my number one priority in life, I love to see them happy, grow and succeed in life. 

As I always believe that education is a crucial key for success in life, I read a quote about education that says: 
> Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself.
 
One of the things that I wanted to achieve during the last couple of years is to go back to college. So, this year was my first year in [Wake Technical Community College](www.waketech.edu), I am so proud of myself that I took the first step to achieve my dreams, it is challenging being a parent and a student at the same time but certainly is rewarding at the end. I believe that time management, perseverance and persistence are the main keys to achieve anything we want despite its difficulty.
I chose to pursue *_Computer Programing and development_* as my major in Wake Tech as I feel passionate to learn the essential skills and knowledge to succeed and obtain my degree.
